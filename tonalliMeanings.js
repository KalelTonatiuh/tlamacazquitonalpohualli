Ome Tochtli is distinctively bad).\nGOOD ATTRIBUTES/FORTUNE:\n  - (Mitigation through proper upbringing and elders' advice might apply, though text says \"this could not be remedied\").\nBAD ATTRIBUTES/MISFORTUNE:\n  - Anyone born under this sign would become a drunkard, one inclined to drink wine, who would not care for anything else but wine.\n  - As soon as he wakes up in the morning, he drinks wine and cannot think of anything else but wine. And so he gets drunk every day; he even drinks it on an empty stomach.\n  - As soon as the sun rises, he goes off to the innkeepers’ homes and begs them to please give him some wine. And he cannot find any peace without drinking wine.\n  - It does not sicken him or cause nausea in him, even if they are the dregs of the wine, with flies and straw [in them]: he just drinks it like that.\n  - If he does not have the means to buy wine, he trades his cape or maxtlatl that clothes him for wine, so he then ends up becoming poor.\n  - He cannot stop drinking wine, nor can he forget it, nor can he spend a single day without getting drunk.\n  - He goes falling down, covered in dust, red faced, completely disheveled and ridiculous, and very filthy.\n  - He does not wash his face, even if he falls down and hurts himself, injuring his face or nose or legs or knees; or else he breaks his hands or feet, et cetera. He does not care about any of this, even if he is covered with bruises and injuries from falling down because of going around drunk.\n  - He cannot accomplish anything, and his hands tremble.\n  - When he speaks, he does not know what he is saying: he talks like a drunkard, and he says insulting and hurtful words, scolding and defaming others, screaming and howling, and boasting that he is a brave man.\n  - He goes around dancing and singing out loud. And he despises everyone. And he fears nothing.\n  - He hurls sticks or stones and whatever he may have at hand.\n  - He goes around bothering everyone, standing in the way and blocking the path of those who pass by on the street.\n  - He impoverishes his children; and he frightens them and scares them away.\n  - He does not go to sleep peacefully but goes around restlessly until he gets tired.\n  - He cannot remember what is needed in his house—to make fire or anything else that may be needed for his home—but he only cares about getting drunk.\n  - Therefore his house is very filthy, full of manure, dust, or salt residues; and no one is there to sweep and light the fire. His house is dark and sunk in poverty.\n  - He sleeps not at his own house but in other people’s houses, and he cannot think of anything else but the tavern.\n  - When he cannot find wine to drink, he feels very dejected and sad, going here and there in search of wine.\n  - If he enters some houses and some drunkards are there drinking wine, he enjoys himself very much, and his heart finds rest; and he sits down at ease to have fun with the drunkards. And he never thinks about leaving that house.\n  - If they invite him to drink wine in some [other] house, he stands up right away and happily goes running there, because he has already lost his shame and is shameless. He fears nobody.\n  - Everybody despises him for this reason, for being a publicly shamed man. And everybody is disgusted by him and hates him. Nobody wants to have a conversation with him because he gets all his friends confused and scares away those who were with him. And they leave him alone because he is the enemy of his friends.\n  - They said that this could not be remedied, for he had been born under that sign.\n  - Everyone would despair of him, saying that he would end up drowning in some stream or lake, or that he would fall from a cliff into some ravine, or that some robbers would steal everything he had and leave him naked.\n  - The drunkard commits many shameless acts, such as sleeping with married women, stealing other people’s belongings, jumping over walls, raping some women or fooling around with them. And he does of all this because he is drunk and out of control.\n  - At dawn, when the drunkard wakes up, his face is all swollen and deformed, and he does not look at all like a person. He always goes around yawning.\n  - Wine only sickens one who is not fond of drinking when he gets drunk; it makes his eyes and head hurt. And he does not get up but sleeps all day instead. And he loses his appetite, but the sight of food only makes him sick, and he returns to his senses only with difficulty.\nREMEDIES/MITIGATION:\n  - The text states: \"this could not be remedied, for he had been born under that sign.\" (However, general mitigation principles of penance might still be attempted).\n\n \n\n ",

    "4_2": "The seventh sign was called Ce Quiahuitl. They said that it was unfortunate because, as they said, the goddesses who were called Cihuateteoh would descend to earth during this house and inflict many illnesses on young boys and girls. Their parents would order their children very sternly not to step out of their homes, telling them, “Do not go outside the house, because if you go out, you will run into the goddesses called Cihuateteoh, who are now coming down to earth.” The fathers and the mothers were afraid that their children would contract palsy if they went anywhere outside while this sign ruled. They would make offerings at the altars of these goddesses, for there were plenty of these in many places, and they would cover the statues of these goddesses with paper. While this sign ruled, they would also kill those who had been jailed for some crime that was worthy of death. And they would also kill slaves in order to increase the life of the lord, so that he might live for many years.\nAlmost all of the houses of this sign had an evil disposition.\nGENERAL BAD ATTRIBUTES FOR THOSE BORN UNDER CE QUIAHUITL (if not mitigated by specific day's luck):\n  - They said that those born under this sign would be necromancers or deceivers or sorcerers: they would transform themselves into animals and knew words used to cast spells on women and to bend their hearts to [make them do] whatever they wanted, and for other curses.\n  - To accomplish this, they would hire themselves out to those who wished to do harm to their enemies and who wished them dead; they would perform their magic spells at night, for four nights [in a row]. They would choose [four nights] under an unlucky sign, and they would go at night to the homes of those whom they intended to harm.\n  - Sometimes they would catch them [the sorcerers] right there because, if those whom they were about to bewitch happened to be brave, they would spy on them, ambush them, and tear their hair off the crown of their heads; and thus [the sorcerers] would die as soon as they got home.\n  - Some said that [the sorcerers] would remedy this if they borrowed something from that home: water, fire, or some vessel. And the one who had torn the hair off [the sorcerer’s head], if he was smart, would stay awake all day long so that nobody would take anything out of his home—no object that had been borrowed or procured in any other way. And that is how that necromancer would die.\n  - These people never found any pleasure or contentment. They would always go about poorly dressed and with a sour expression. They had not a single friend, nor did they ever go inside someone’s home, nor did anyone love them.\n  - If the one born under this sign happened to be a woman, she never got married, even if she happened to be a noblewoman, nor would she prosper. She would always walk from house to house, and everyone said that the sign under which she had been born had bestowed that [wretched] condition on her.\nBAPTISM (GENERAL FOR TRECENA):\n  - They would not baptize those born under this sign [that same day], but they would defer [the ceremony] until the third house, called Yei Cipactli. They said that this [third] house improved the fortune of the one who was being baptized.\nUNIVERSAL LUCK NOTE FOR THIS TRECENA (Overriding the general unfortunateness for specific days):\n  - The tenth house and the thirteenth house were universally lucky in all the signs. (This is then expanded upon for houses 10, 11, 12, 13 of this specific trecena).\nGeneral condition for losing good luck (applies to any lucky sign/day): if he did not perform penance... he would then lose everything that he had deserved...

(Number 4 usually unlucky).\nGENERAL NOTES/RULERS/RITUALS:\n  - The fourth house of Ce Quiahuitl's trecena.\n  - They would kill the adulterers at night while this sign ruled. And at dawn, they would toss them in the water.\n  - They would also kill captives on behalf of the lord’s life, so that he might live for many more years, as is mentioned above in [the discussion of] the other sign called Ce Quiahuitl.\n  - While this sign ruled, the necromancers would perform their curses and spells, and they were very afraid of this sign Nauhecatl. This is why they would place and insert thistles in the windows. They said that this would make the sorcerers run away.\n  - The rich merchants called acxotecah honored this sign and would display in its honor all the precious things that they kept in their homes: precious stones and jewels, all the rich feathers of every color, wrought animal hides, hand mills for cacao, turtle lids for tecomates, and all the jewelry that they had.\n  - And they would arrange all this neatly on top of a rich cloth in the patio of their church, which is called calpulco. And they would burn incense and offer quails’ blood. They said that they did this to honor this sign, as if they were warming everything mentioned above in the sun.\n  - Once they had performed their devotions, all the merchants and their guests would begin to eat and drink. And they would give smoking tubes to each one of them, so that the smoke that hovered there seemed like fog; and [they would also give them] flowers.\n  - And the merchants, [who were both] older men and women, would gather together at night and get drunk. And each one of them would brag there about what they had earned, about the lands that they had roamed, about the remote regions that they had reached and had passed through, and about the dangers that they had faced in enemy lands. With such tales, they would insult others who had not gone to distant lands, telling them that they had always stayed by the hearth and did not know other markets except for the tianquiz near their homes. They would spend the whole night like this, chatting and shouting at one another, with some of them looking down on others, and each one praising himself.\nGOOD ATTRIBUTES/FORTUNE:\n  - Those born under this sign (Nahui Ehecatl within Ce Quiahuitl trecena) would be prosperous, fortunate, and brave (though baptism deferred).\n  - If the person born under this sign is raised correctly, their destiny would be diverged and they will be prosperous and of good disposition (General mitigation for any negative potential).\nBAD ATTRIBUTES/MISFORTUNE:\n  - This fourth house of this sign, Nauhecatl, was one of bad omen. Everybody took care not to quarrel or stumble. They were afraid for anyone to stumble, get hurt, or quarrel. They said that this would always keep happening to this person because that sign demanded it to be so.\nREMEDIES/MITIGATION:\n  - Avoid quarreling or stumbling on this day.\n  - Perform penance, proper upbringing, heed elders' advice.\nBAPTISM:\n  - They were not baptized right away, but they would defer them instead to the seventh house of another sign (likely means \"seventh house *of this current* sign,\" Chicome Coatl, or implies a general good seventh house), called Chicome Coatl. The masters of this art said that the fortune of the newborn would improve, becoming more prosperous, because this Chicome Coatl was the sign of all food, and it was a lucky one, since it was the seventh, a number that was lucky.\n\n \n\n ",
